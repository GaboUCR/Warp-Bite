what is the best strategy to read infinite buffers (bite strategy??)


url must be an env variable (use bite- or bitews strategy)

-Investigate rust's profilers (what is the most expensive part of my program)
-tokio console

-bite limitation on message sizes

-error logging for Bite and Warp-Bite, we should know what is wrong



-what should be registered in tests

-x handle disconnections (done not fully tested)
-x stress test, zoom calls, every message will be received to everyone
